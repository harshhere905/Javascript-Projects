# JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my collection of small JavaScript projects! These projects are simple applications and scripts created to practice and demonstrate fundamental JavaScript concepts. Each project is designed to be easy to understand and modify, making it a great starting point for those new to JavaScript.

## Projects Included

1. **Weather App**  
   A basic weather application that fetches real-time weather data using an API and displays it to the user based on their location or city input.

2. **Notes App**  
   A simple notes application where users can add, edit, and delete notes. It allows for local storage of notes, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

3. **To-Do List**  
   A simple to-do list application that lets users add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. It uses local storage to persist the tasks.

4. **Calculator**  
   A basic calculator for performing simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

5. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**  
   A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against another player in a browser.
